# üß† Face Detection Matching Rules
detect:
  match:
    save: true                  # Save matched face images
    base64: false               # Include base64 in results (true, false, or 'box')
    confidence: 60              # Confidence threshold for matches
    purge: 168                  # Auto-delete match images after hours
    min_area: 10000             # Minimum face area (px) to count as valid

  unknown:
    save: true                  # Save unknown face images
    base64: false               # Include base64 in results (true, false, or 'box')
    confidence: 40              # Confidence threshold for unknowns
    purge: 8                    # Auto-delete unknown images after hours
    min_area: 0                 # Minimum face area (px) to keep
