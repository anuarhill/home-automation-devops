# üß± Proxmox LXC Provisioning (Infrastructure as Code)

This folder contains shell scripts to provision unprivileged LXC containers on a **Proxmox VE** host for the **Home Automation DevOps** project. Each container is configured for a specific service (e.g., Home Assistant, MQTT, Frigate, Monitoring stack) and follows IaC principles.
